# INFINITY CODE USER GUIDE

 The object of this application is to provide the User with the ability to change some of their information and to view their Competencies, Assessment, and Results. It will also provide the Manager with those same abilities, and then also a broader range of search, views, adds, edits, deletes, activations/deactivations, exports,  and imports.
